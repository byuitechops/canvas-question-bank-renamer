# Preliminary Design

## Magic Box Chart

![magic box](assets/finalMagicBox.jpg)

## Explanation of Design
bin.js will handle inputs and outputs. It will send the search and replace args and also some format of the courses to change. Main will open a browser instance, navigate to a course, search and replace all the text fields, update a log string, then navigate to another course and continue till all courses are complete. Then, main will return the log string and bin.js will output it to a text file for further review.

### Used Libraries

- puppeteer
- d3-dsv

## Things to Consider Before Getting Project Approved
- Are there any approved libraries that I can use? [Link to Approved Library List]
- Are there design patterns that will help?  [Link to Design Patterns]
- Can I design it so that it is a general tool instead of a specific solution?
- How can it be easily expanded?
- What does the minimum viable product look like?

## Prep for Learning Phase
- What do I need to learn
- How will I learn it
- What will I do to learn it (prototypes/tutorials/research time limit?)
- What is the definition of done for my learning process
- How do I measure the progress of learning
- Is there a deliverable that can be created during the learning process?

## Component Diagrams
<!-- Diagrams and companion explanations for all Key Components.
These would include information about inputs, outputs, and what a function does for every major function. -->

<!-- For each component, the following template will be followed: (In other words, the template below will repeat for each component)-->

### *Main function*

<!-- Diagram Types:
 - Data Flow (I think this will be the most popular)
 - Structure Charts (This is really good for showing input and output of every function)
 - UML Class Diagram (a must for object oriented projects) -->
